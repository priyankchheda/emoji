    we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved
    far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow
    exchange of far items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large
    value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is
    said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
